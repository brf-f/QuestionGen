# QuestionGen
 
## A small lightweight application meant to generate a random question for the __IB.__ Curriculum

- Can generate a question from a **random** or **specified** subject

## How to use?

- Download all 3 items from [here](https://github.com/brf-f/QuestionGen/tree/main/Setup-Downloadables) 
- Then run setup.exe

Once the app is installed you can create a desktop shortcut if it wasn't already or you can simply run it from search.

## Features

- The question is generated on load
- You can **generate a new question** using the button in the top-right
- You can **copy the question to your clipboard** using the button in the top-right if you wish to search for the answer
- **Subject can be specified** from the dropdown menu at the top of the app.
- You can **report an inadequate or broken question** with the top-left report button


## Question Bank

The questionBank is simply a 2D array in the C code. Yes, not the prettiest or most functional way of doing it, but if it works it works :\

Therefore, **new questions are often added**, therefore check the [download folder](https://github.com/brf-f/QuestionGen/tree/main/Setup-Downloadables) for a more up to date version if it exists.

You can also **submit your own questions** with a simple **pull request** containing the modified array. It would be greatly appreciated :)

ðŸš©*Overall, this isn't a major project, just a quick idea I had and implemented for my own personal use*
